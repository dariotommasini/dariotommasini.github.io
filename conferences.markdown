As a Ph.D. student, I have attended several fantastic conferences and workshops, both in the US and abroad! Here are some highlights:

**Society for Neuroscience – San Diego, California (2025).** I had a blast at this conference, where we learned about spatial navigation in freely moving human patients (Prof. Nanthia Suthana), speech production and comprehension (Prof. Edward Chang), and the current state of multiomic analysis in neurodegeneration. I participated in the "Photoreceptors and Retinal Circuitry" nanosymposium, where I gave a talk on the deep evolutionary roots of amacrine cell types.

**Visual Neuroscience Workshop – Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts (2025).** I attended a two-week long workshop with these wonderful folks. We took a variety of modules, including 2-photon calcium imaging from mouse, zebrafish, and octopus, patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and zebrafish behavior.

**Berkeley Neuroscience Conference – Granlibakken Tahoe (2024).** I presented a poster on the evolutionary conservation of amacrine cells in the vertebrate retina. I also gave a five minute lightning talk on the evolutionary origin of the tetrapod double cone.

**Gordon Research Conference, Lucca Italy (2024).** I presented a poster on amacrine cell evolution. I met many cool researchers working on visual system development and got to enjoy an italian sandwich in Florence! I had a great time hanging out with my lab mates in Italy: Matthew Po, Josh Hahn, and Sal Butrus.

**Berkeley Neuroscience Conference – Granlibakken Tahoe (2023).** This was my first poster presentation, and I received a lot of great feedback on my project. I had a great time hanging out with the Berkeley Neuroscience community!
