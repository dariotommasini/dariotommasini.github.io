As a Ph.D. student, I have attended several fantastic conferences, both in the US and abroad!

**Berkeley Neuroscience Conference – Granlibakken Tahoe (2024).** I presented a poster on the evolutionary conservation of amacrine cells in the vertebrate retina. I also gave a five minute lightning talk on the evolutionary origin of the tetrapod double cone.

**Gordon Research Conference, Lucca Italy (2024).** I presented a poster on amacrine cell evolution. I met many cool researchers working on visual system development and got to enjoy an italian sandwich in Florence! I had a great time hanging out with my lab mates in Italy: Matthew Po, Josh Hahn, and Sal Butrus.

**Berkeley Neuroscience Conference – Granlibakken Tahoe (2023).** This was my first poster presentation, and I received a lot of great feedback on my project. I had a great time hanging out with the Berkeley Neuroscience community!
