I am a rising fourth year Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at University of California, Berkeley working in Prof. Karthik Shekharâ€™s lab. I am applying single-cell genomic methods to investigate the evolution of retinal neuronal types across vertebrates. Additionally, I have been assisting with two other collaborations, namely analyzing immune cell signatures in mouse models of neurodegeneration, and classifying displaced amacrine cells using patch-sequencing. This past year, I have been collaborating with Prof. Teresa Puthussery to validate some of our computational predictions using wet-lab experiments.
