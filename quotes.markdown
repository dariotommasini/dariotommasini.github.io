I've had the privelege to work with many great people. Here are some of my favorite quotes from them!


* "Whenever you’re feeling inadequate, just remember Fischer invented ML as a grad student" – anonymous professor

* "When you fail, you have two options: try harder or redefine success" – anonymous student

* "The only thing that separates science from alchemy is a positive and negative control" – anonymous mentor
