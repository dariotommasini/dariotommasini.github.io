* *"The only thing that separates science from alchemy is a positive and negative control"* <br>– Anonymous Mentor

* *"Whenever you’re feeling inadequate, just remember Fisher came up with maximum likelihood as a grad student"* <br>– Anonymous Professor

* *"The reward for good work is more work"* <br>– Anonymous Mentor
